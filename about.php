		<p>So this is me. My name is Frank Kalk, currently living in The Netherlands. I like doing front-end development. My skills in front-end are: CSS2, CSS3, XHTML, HTML, PHP and finally JavaScript. I have also dabbled in D3 (Data-Driven Documents), a JavaScript library for visualizing data.</p>
		<p>I'm also a proud owner of <a href="http://blog.fpck.nl">a blog</a>, which I update at least once a year (promise). Concerning the 'fpck' part, both on the blog and this website: they simply are my initials. I like the look of 'em.</p>

		<h1>About this website</h1>
		<p>The idea was simple: update my portfolio to be responsive, fast, clean and semantic. I got inspired by sites as <a href="http://www.medium.com">Medium</a> where the focus was on the content, and where I could spend a lot of time just reading.</p>
		<p>More on how I made this website and the decisions I made are available on <a href="http://www.github.com/fpckalk/fpck">my GitHub</a>.</p>
