		GamerGeeks is a group of Dutch gaming enthousiasts who like to share their honest opinions about videogames with the world via YouTube. They asked me to make a website where they could have their own spot, categorize videos, post updates and stream some games they're playing.
		I decided to make the whole thing in Wordpress, the well known blogging platform that is slowly turning into a content management system. This decision was based on my previous experiences and the expertise I built up with Wordpress whilst developing <a href="http://www.spotonagency.nl">spotonagency.nl</a>. Particularly the ease of use for the editors and the amount of documentation available are what did it for me.

	<p>At first it didn't seem like there were that many hurdles. Only when developing it became apparent that something as 'Add a customizable banner' would become 'Add a customizable banner consisting of three parts, sometimes two, that is fully compatible with whatever image they upload'.</p>
	<p>It was pretty tough to develop this one as I came across a lot of things that I hadn't dealt with before. User registration for instance, something I'd never tried before on a WordPress installation. Shielding off certain areas, smooth registration, confirmation e-mails all came into play. It took some time to fully implement, and I wish it'd been easier. But it turned out nice.</p>

	<p>Styling was a bit tricky on the mobile part. I didn't specify any mobile site for the GamerGeeks, but I did develop it for a little surprise at the end. This resulted in only designing a desktop version at first, which was difficult to translate to mobile (it's usually better to go mobile first). Really had to get down and dirty to finetune a lot of elements, which unfortunately resulted in not so clean code.</p>
	<p>Developing this really helped me out about knowing where the boundaries of WordPress were. Luckily WordPress's good sides outshine the bad, and I'd happily develop another WordPress theme.</p>
