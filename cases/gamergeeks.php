		GamerGeeks is a group of Dutch gaming enthousiasts who like to share their honest opinions about videogames with the world via YouTube. They asked me to make a website where they could have their own spot, categorize videos, post updates and stream some games they're playing.
		I decided to make the whole thing in Wordpress, the well known blogging platform that is slowly turning into a content management system. This decision was based on my previous experiences and the expertise I built up with Wordpress whilst developing <a href="http://www.spotonagency.nl">spotonagency.nl</a>. Particularly the ease of use for the editors and the amount of documentation available are what did it for me.

	<p>At first it didn't seem like there were that many hurdles. Only when developing it became apparent that something as 'Add a customizable banner' would become 'Add a customizable banner consisting of three parts, sometimes two, that is fully compatible with whatever image they upload'.</p>
