	<p>Unfortunately not online yet</p>
	<p>A great artist once asked the question: Frank, would thou be willing to developeth mine portfolio? And Frank did thus reply 'yes', for he was quite impressed by the artist's bitching work.</p>
	<p>After becoming quite used to WordPress, this was the second full theme I made. Again with the help of the <a target="_blank" href="http://themble.com/bones/">Bones framework</a> a theme was created without any unnecessary clutter, giving me a lot of control and clarity over the theme.</p>
	<p>It honestly was a dream to develop this website. Its basic layout was done in collaboration with the artist Sjoerd, and was perfected by him and his girlfriend both. This resulted in a design which was so elegantly simple that coding it just made a lot of sense. No special CSS exceptions, no weird elements that were out of place.</p>
	<p>I didn't encounter any major problems along the way, pretty much a smooth ride. I am thankful for being able to work on this website.</p>
